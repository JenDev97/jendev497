### Hey there, I'm Jennifer Guerra 👋🏼

## I am self-taught and currently learning programming 👩‍💻.

I'm from Mexico 🇲🇽 and of course, I love tacos 🌮. Just like many other programmers, I also love cats 🐈 (<span style="font-size: small;">_The internet is controlled by them_</span>).

Now I'm learning web development.
